# GitHub Pages Clean URL Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of clean URLs for the Inherit Tomorrow website on GitHub Pages.

## Current Implementation Status

The site has been updated to use React Router's `BrowserRouter` for clean URL support, with the following components:

1. **React Router Implementation**
   - Replaced hash-based routing with `BrowserRouter`
   - Added proper route components with path-based navigation
   - Implemented protected route handling

2. **GitHub Pages SPA Fallback**
   - Added 404.html with redirect logic to handle direct URL access
   - Added redirect script to index.html to restore the path after fallback

## Known Limitations

GitHub Pages has inherent limitations with true SPA routing:

1. **Fallback Behavior**: When accessing a subroute directly (e.g., `/pricing`), the 404.html redirects to the root, but the path information may not be fully preserved.

2. **Path Restoration**: The current implementation redirects to the homepage when accessing subroutes directly, rather than loading the specific subroute content.

## Potential Enhancements

To fully support clean URLs with direct access to subroutes on GitHub Pages:

1. **Enhanced Redirect Script**: Modify the redirect script in 404.html and index.html to better preserve and restore the full path.

2. **Custom Domain**: Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages can provide more flexibility for URL handling.

3. **Alternative Hosting**: Consider platforms like Netlify or Vercel that have built-in SPA fallback support.

## Navigation Best Practices

Until the limitations are addressed:

1. Share the base URL of the site and instruct users to navigate to specific sections using the UI.
2. For in-app navigation, continue using the React Router navigation methods.
