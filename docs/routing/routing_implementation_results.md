# Browser History API Routing Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to implement Browser History API routing with server configuration for the Inherit Tomorrow website.

## Changes Made

1. **Installed React Router Dom**
   - Added `react-router-dom` package to the project

2. **Updated App.tsx**
   - Replaced hash-based routing with React Router's `BrowserRouter`
   - Implemented proper route components with path-based navigation
   - Added protected route handling for authenticated routes
   - Created a fallback route for 404 handling

3. **Added Server Configuration**
   - Created a `404.html` file for GitHub Pages SPA fallback
   - Added redirect script to `index.html` to handle direct URL navigation
   - Ensured proper basename configuration for the router

4. **Updated Navigation Logic**
   - Modified navigation functions to use React Router's `useNavigate` hook
   - Updated all navigation calls to use path-based routes instead of hash fragments

## Benefits of the New Implementation

- **Clean URLs**: Users now see `/about` instead of `/#about` in the address bar
- **SEO Benefits**: Search engines can better index individual pages
- **Shareable Links**: Direct links to specific pages work naturally
- **Browser Navigation**: Forward/back buttons work more intuitively
- **Analytics**: Page views are tracked more accurately in analytics tools

## Testing Results

The implementation has been thoroughly tested and validated:
- Direct URL navigation works for all pages
- In-app navigation functions correctly
- Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated
- Browser back/forward navigation works as expected
- Mobile and desktop views function properly
