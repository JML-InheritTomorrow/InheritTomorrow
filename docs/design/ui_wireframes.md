|  Clear documentation of property ownership helps     |
|  prevent "heirs' property" situations that have      |
|  historically led to loss of land and homes in       |
|  Black communities. Be specific about who receives   |
|  real estate and under what conditions.              |

|  | What is a Healthcare Directive?                  ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | A Healthcare Directive (also called an Advance   ||
|  | Directive) allows you to:                        ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | • Appoint someone you trust to make medical      ||
|  |   decisions if you cannot speak for yourself     ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | • Document your wishes for medical treatment     ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | • Specify your preferences for end-of-life care  ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | This document helps ensure your values and       ||
|  | wishes are respected.                            ||
|  +--------------------------------------------------+|

|  FAITH AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS                      |
|                                                      |
|  Many people worry that advance planning conflicts   |
|  with their faith. Creating a healthcare directive   |
|  doesn't mean giving up hope or faith in healing.    |
|  It means ensuring your values guide your care if    |
|  you cannot speak for yourself.                      |

|  +--------------------------------------------------+|
|  | What is a Financial Power of Attorney?           ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | A Financial Power of Attorney allows you to:     ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | • Appoint someone you trust to manage your       ||
|  |   finances if you become unable to do so         ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | • Specify what financial powers they will have   ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | • Protect your assets and ensure bills are paid  ||
|  |   during periods of incapacity                   ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | This document helps prevent court-appointed      ||
|  | guardianship and protects family assets.         ||
|  +--------------------------------------------------+|
|                                                      |
|  PROTECTING YOUR FAMILY'S FINANCIAL SECURITY         |
|                                                      |
|  Without a Financial Power of Attorney, your family  |
|  may face court costs and delays in accessing funds  |
|  needed for your care or household expenses if you   |
|  become incapacitated. This document is especially   |
|  important for protecting homes and property that    |
|  have been in families for generations.              |
|                                                      |

|  A Durable Power of Attorney is often recommended    |
|  because it ensures your agent can act immediately   |
|  in emergencies. A Springing Power only activates    |
|  when you're incapacitated, but this can cause       |
|  delays while doctors certify your condition.        |

|  | HOW TO TALK WITH YOUR FAMILY ABOUT YOUR WISHES   ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | Starting the conversation about your estate      ||
|  | plans with family members can be challenging,    ||
|  | but it's essential for ensuring your wishes      ||
|  | are understood and respected.                    ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | SUGGESTED APPROACH:                              ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | 1. Choose the right time and setting             ||
|  |    • A relaxed family gathering                  ||
|  |    • Not during holidays or stressful times      ||
|  |    • A private setting without distractions      ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | 2. Frame the conversation positively             ||
|  |    • "I want to make things easier for you"      ||
|  |    • "This is about protecting our family legacy"||
|  |    • "I'm doing this because I love you"         ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | 3. Be prepared for emotional responses           ||
|  |    • Some may be uncomfortable discussing death  ||
|  |    • Others may have strong opinions             ||
|  |    • Listen respectfully to concerns             ||
|  |                                                  ||
|  | 4. Focus on key information                      ||
|  |    • Where important documents are kept          ||
|  |    • Who you've chosen as agents and why         ||
|  |    • Your values and wishes for care             ||
|  +--------------------------------------------------+|

|                                                      |
|  In many Black families, there may be:               |
|  • Respect for elders that makes discussing their    |
|    mortality uncomfortable                           |
|  • Strong faith traditions that influence views on   |
|    end-of-life care                                  |
|  • Family dynamics where certain members have more   |
|    influence in decisions                            |
