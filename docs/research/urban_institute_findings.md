# Urban Institute Research Findings on Black Americans and Estate Planning

## Key Statistics
- Nearly 70 percent of Black homeowners do not have a will or trust, compared to 35 percent of white homeowners
- 76 percent of Hispanic homeowners do not have a will or trust
- The typical Black family has just 15 percent of the wealth the typical white family holds
- The typical Hispanic family has just 20 percent of the wealth the typical white family holds

## Financial Barriers
- More than 60 percent of older Black and Hispanic homeowners without wills do not have even $500 in liquid wealth
- Only 27 percent of white homeowners without wills have less than $500 in liquid assets
- Most Black and Hispanic homeowners have their wealth tied up in their homes, making it difficult to pay for estate planning services
- Probate costs can be 3 to 10 percent of the estate's total value, creating additional financial burdens for heirs

## Legal Complications
- When a homeowner passes away without a will, their property becomes "heirs' property"
- Heirs' property is an unstable form of ownership that requires going through probate
- Probate is both expensive and time-consuming
- Properties that cannot be physically divided result in fractional ownership stakes
- Fractional owners cannot fully access the wealth-building benefits of homeownership
- Tangled property titles do not accurately reflect who owns the home
- This constricts the flow of housing wealth from one generation to the next

## Recommendations from Urban Institute
1. Authorize state funding for counseling and pro bono legal assistance
   - Provide financial counseling and pro bono legal assistance to property owners without wills
   - Focus on those who lack liquidity or financial assets to buffer the costs of estate planning
   - Give homeowners agency over what happens to their assets in the future

2. Engage community partners to build trust
   - Work with trusted community partners to build cultural competency
   - Establish credibility and best reach those in need
   - Address hesitancy to seek estate planning services

## Impact
- Without intervention, the situation could lead to further widening of the racial wealth gap
- Addressing these barriers is critical to reducing the wealth gap
- Policymakers have an opportunity to tackle this problem and reduce racial and ethnic homeownership and wealth gaps for generations to come
