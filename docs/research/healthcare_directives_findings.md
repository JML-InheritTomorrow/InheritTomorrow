# Healthcare Directives and Cultural Considerations for Black Americans

## Key Statistics
- Only 15% of older Black Americans complete advance directives, compared to 52% of older White Americans
- Black Americans tend to elect more aggressive measures than White patients at the end of life despite limited potential benefit
- African American families tend to choose life-prolonging interventions when faced with advanced, terminal conditions rather than focusing on comfort care and quality of life

## Cultural and Religious Factors
- Strong faith in God and belief in miracles influences end-of-life decisions
- Religious beliefs may lead to the perception that preparing for end-of-life contradicts faith in God
- Many Black Americans have grown up with Biblical stories of miraculous healings and resurrections
- Family-centered decision making is common, with reliance on loved ones for important decisions
- Deference to elders who may feel uncomfortable discussing end-of-life matters

## Medical Mistrust
- Deep distrust of the healthcare system stemming from historical injustices:
  - The infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment
  - Exploitation of enslaved people's bodies for medical research
  - Unauthorized use of Henrietta Lacks' cells
  - Ongoing disparities in treatment and care
- Concerns that suggesting end-of-life care may mean receiving less aggressive treatment due to racial bias
- Fear that doctors may not provide the same level of care to Black patients

## Knowledge and Access Barriers
- Limited knowledge about what should be included in advance care planning
- Limited access to culturally competent legal and medical professionals
- Financial barriers to obtaining professional assistance with advance directives

## Recommendations for Improvement
- Acknowledge patients' religious beliefs in conversations about end-of-life care
- Reframe the idea of a miracle to include quality time with loved ones, relief from pain, fewer hospital trips, or a sense of peace
- Partner with leaders in the African American faith community
- Develop advance care planning ambassadors - respected lay leaders who receive special training
- Train former caregivers to serve as peer mentors to Black patients with life-limiting illnesses
- Ensure culturally competent care that focuses on the whole patient
- Build trust through authentic relationships and listening
- Diversify hospice staff
- Build community partnerships to create culturally acceptable materials
- Provide advance directive coaches to facilitate completion of necessary documents
