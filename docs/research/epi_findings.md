# Economic Policy Institute Research on Heirs' Property and Black Wealth

## Key Statistics and Historical Context
- African American household income is about 60% of white household income
- African American household wealth is only 5% of white household wealth
- Over half of white Americans have a will, compared with only 24% of African Americans
- Government housing policy in the early to mid-twentieth century exacerbated the wealth gap
- White families were subsidized for homeownership while Black families were explicitly excluded
- Even Black families who managed to purchase homes were forced into less-resourced neighborhoods where home values didn't appreciate as much

## Heirs' Property Issues
- When a property owner dies without a will, their property becomes "heirs' property"
- This designation puts families at risk of losing their homes and wealth
- There is no easy way to get a home out of being an heirs property once designated
- Most states require agreement by all heirs to change the ownership structure
- This can be difficult or impossible with dozens of heirs spread across the country or world
- The process requires significant resources for fees, appraisals, and legal assistance

## Legal Complications
- Without a clear title, occupants can't qualify for loans using the property as collateral
- They are disqualified from many government-funded programs for homeowners
- They cannot access disaster relief or the "homestead exemption" that reduces property taxes
- Rising property taxes without exemptions can lead to missed payments, liens, and foreclosure
- Under partition laws (in effect in 28 states), any heir can force the sale of the entire property
- Investors and developers exploit this by buying small shares from distant relatives and forcing sales
- Family members rarely have the cash to buy the home at auction, leading to loss of generational property

## Reasons for Low Will Creation Rates
- Families with fewer assets may think estate planning is unnecessary
- Black households may be less aware of the benefits of having a will
- Black households may be less likely to trust the legal system
- Legal expenses associated with creating an estate plan can be a deterrent

## Impact on Wealth Building
- For many Black families, wealth they had built was lost rather than fairly inherited
- This contributes to the widening racial wealth gap
- Without intervention, the situation could lead to further erosion of Black wealth
- Addressing these barriers is critical to preserving generational wealth in Black communities
