## Rationale for Important Decisions

### Cultural Relevance Focus
The platform prioritizes cultural relevance for Black Americans in estate planning because:
- Research shows significant wealth gaps and lower rates of estate planning in Black communities
- Cultural context improves engagement and trust in legal processes
- Addressing specific historical and legal challenges faced by Black Americans improves outcomes

### Tiered Pricing Model
The SaaS model with free, premium, and subsidized tiers was chosen because:
- It provides accessible entry points for all users regardless of financial situation
- Premium features create sustainable revenue for ongoing development
- Subsidized access ensures the platform serves its core mission while remaining financially viable

### Standard GitHub Repository Layout
The repository follows standard conventions because:
- Improves discoverability and navigation for developers
- Facilitates collaboration and onboarding of new team members
- Ensures compatibility with common development tools and deployment services
- Separates concerns between source code, documentation, and static assets
